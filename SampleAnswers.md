\*Question 1:
Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:

- Records
- Indexing

I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers,
George\*

Hi George,

Welcome to the world of search engines! I can most definitely help you define these concepts:
In broad terms, an index would be a directory of sorts and records would be the data entries in said index. An related analogy would be a phone book being an index and each phone number within the book being a record.
With Algolia, each of your records would consist of key-value pairs containing any sort of information you would like to utilize in search, display or filtering. An Algolia Index would be a collection of these records.
Here is a link to documentation if you would like to read up more on this: [https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/#algolia-records](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/#algolia-records)
For custom ranking, the metrics would depend on which products you want to prioritize putting in front of your customers. For example, from a marketing perspective, you may want to increase the visibility of the best selling products on your website, in which case you would add popularity/number of sales to your custom rankings.

\*Question 2:
Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards,
Matt\*
